# Scratch Cloud Database
> ***Persistent Storage in Scratch***

## Demo
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/764232422

## What does it do?
This project adds a way to have persistent storage in your Scratch projects by using the [cloud variables](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Cloud_Data) to send packets between the Scratch project and a Python server. The Python server saves data to a directory, and responds with the data when asked.
